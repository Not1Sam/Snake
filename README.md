## ⚙️ How to Run It

---
### 🔌 Requirements:
- Python 3.x or higher  
- Pygame (duh)
---

### 🟩 Option 1: Use the .EXE (Windows)
- Go to the [**Releases**](./releases) section
- Download `snake.zip` and extract it. 
- Run it. No setup, no pain, just snake.

> 💡 Note: Windows might whine about “unknown publisher.” Ignore it. The snake knows what it's doing.

---

### 🐍 Option 2: Run from Source (Python)

First, clone the repo:

```bash
- git clone https://github.com/Not1Sam/Snake.git
- cd Snake
- py -m venv env
- .\env\Scripts\activate
- pip install Pygame
- python snake.py
```
🔥 Tip: Double-clicking snake.py also works if your setup is clean.
